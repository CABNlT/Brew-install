# Brew-install

Just click on the clipboard button (The button with the 2 overlapping squares directly under this text) and paste this in your terminal app and click yes if anything pops up 
```bash
xcode-select --install | git clone https://github.com/CABNlT/Brew-install.git | sh ~/Brew-install/install_homebrew.sh
```
This will install brew and steam

Once steam is in your desktop connect your computer to your phones mobile hotspot as steams website is blocked on the wifi.(Because the steam store and download links for the games are blocked). I would reccomend making a new steam account if you have one and connecting those two accounts together using their family account feature. If you dont your steam account will be signed out on all other computers.
