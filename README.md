# Brew-install

Just click on the clipboard button and paste this in your terminal app 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CABNlT/Brew-install.git | sh ~/Brew-install/install_homebrew.sh
```
This will install brew and steam

Connect your computer to your phones mobile hotspot as steams website is blocked on the wifi.(Because the steam store and download links for the games are blocked). I would reccomend making a new steam account if you have one and connecting those two accounts together using their family account feature. If you dont your steam account will be signed out on all other computers.
